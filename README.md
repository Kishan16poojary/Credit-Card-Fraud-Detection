# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection System

This project is a Machine Learning application designed to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Objective:** Detect fraud in a highly imbalanced dataset (0.24% fraud cases).
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier.
- **Handling Imbalance:** Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
- **Environment:** Developed in Google Colab and deployed as a local script in VS Code.

## 📊 Performance
The model was evaluated using a Confusion Matrix, achieving high recall for fraud detection to ensure minimal missed fraudulent activities.

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the prediction script: `python predict.py`
